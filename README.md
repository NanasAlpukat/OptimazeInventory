# **Data Driven Inventory Management Optimization for Retail Efficiency and Profitability**

### Project Description
This project aims to optimize inventory management in the retail sector using data-driven techniques, including **Just In Time (JIT)**, **Safety Stock**, and **Reorder Point (ROP)**. The goal is to reduce storage costs, prevent stockouts, and improve procurement efficiency. By utilizing data for better decision-making, this project helps retail businesses enhance their profitability and operational performance.

### Goals
- 🎯 **Optimize inventory management** to reduce storage costs and prevent stockouts.
- 📈 **Increase procurement efficiency** through data-driven cost-benefit analysis.

### Background
Efficient inventory management is crucial in retail to minimize storage costs and prevent stockouts. Poor management can lead to overstock or lost revenue due to stockouts. Therefore, a data-driven approach is needed to improve efficiency and profitability.

### Business Metrics
- 📊 **Profit Growth**: Measures profit growth before and after inventory optimization.
- 💸 **Cost Savings**: Identifies cost reductions from excess inventory and stockouts.
- 📉 **Stockout Rate**: Evaluates the frequency of stockouts.
- 🔄 **Inventory Turnover**: Measures how quickly goods are sold and replaced.

### Business Impact
- 🚀 **Improved Operational Efficiency**: Achieved cost savings of up to 44.7% through JIT implementation.
- 💵 **Increased Profitability**: JIT improved profits by 7.5% to 17.1% monthly.
- ⚖️ **Reduced Risk of Stockout and Overstock**: JIT kept stockout rate at 0%, ensuring optimal stock availability.
